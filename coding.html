        <h2>Problem-Solving featuring Excel and JavaScript</h2>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-info">The issue:</h5>
        <p>A page was to be created that would feature a list of stores that are currently open. Initially there'd be
          80-ish stores, but it would be constantly changing/being updated and could reach more than 300. Unfortunately,
          the data was all stored in an Excel sheet so we couldn't pull the data automatically or anything. Each entry
          had the State, City, Mall Name, Hours, and URL (among other jargon we didn't need). We would have to take that
          information and create an accordion that would divide the stores by state and as you'd click on a state it
          would expand to show all the stores in that state.</p>

        <p>The Bootstrap version we had was stripped down and didn't contain the carousel presets so we'd have to create
          it manually as well - also a whole different story on how to get working.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-info">Management's proposed solution:</h5>
        <p>We split up the stores and manually type up information and code it and then piece it all together. Not only
          would it take hours, but it would be a hassle each time it would need to be updated.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-info">My solution:</h5>
        <p>I didn't think this was a very good use of our time so I started brainstorming ways to automate or at least
          make the whole process easier. I knew you could convert a spreadsheet to an HTML table so I figured I'd start
          there.</p>

        <p>I copied all the data on the Excel sheet and pasted it into a new document and deleted everything we didn't
          need. I sorted it by State and created a new column with a function that would grab the URL and the Mall Name
          and format it as such: &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;MALL NAME&lt;/a&gt;</p>

        <p>The function ended up looking like this:</p>
        <p><em>=CHAR(60)&"a"&" " &"href=" & CHAR(34)& B1 &CHAR(34) &CHAR(62) &A1 &CHAR(60)&CHAR(47)&"a"&CHAR(62)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In order to escape the characters USCII codes were to be used alongside the CHAR function and combined
          together using &.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid"
          src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/420be6993c2eec001681da21be48dd29/dee5a7c186693129-13/s1280x1920/0afe43ccf2f8b7707002feec33173bb62f629f60.png">

        <p class="mt-3">I copied the column of newly created a href's and created a new column and pasted only the
          values and then went and deleted the Mall Name column and the column with the function. I then converted it
          all to HTML. It was then a matter of Finding and Replacing with the correct info. And although it did beat
          having to manually type out every entry as it significantly decreased the amount of time it'd take and it
          removed any human error, it was still a bit time consuming.</p>

        <p class="mt-5">Here the top part is what the CSV-to-HTML data looked like and the bottom part was the end goal:
        </p>

        <img class="img-fluid mt-1"
          src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5a32eaf36b22cf035865528e7127b29f/dee5a7c186693129-b1/s1280x1920/61448b31e9963f3a43fd464dde219b819a1d1b58.png"
          width="500">

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-info">So I thought, well, what if I use JavaScript?</h5>
        <p>Initially, I thought about perhaps using Python but admin privileges were required to install an interpreter.
          Plus, I figured a HMTL with JavaScript saved in a network drive would be easiest of all options as it'd run in
          a browser.</p>

        <p>I created an HTML file with two text areas and a Submit button. Pasting the converted HTML text on the left
          and clicking submit would run a JavaScript function that would output the result instantly in the second text
          area.</p>

        <p>I defined variables for each State and what to replace each one with. Using the string.replace method I
          replaced all the first instances of each state.</p>

        <p>For example, the first instance of <td>Arkansas</td> was replaced with the part that started from &lt;div
          class=“accordionWrapper”&gt; and ended with &lt;table class=“data-table”&gt; and it would do this for every
          State.</p>

        <p>Then once that was finished, I used the .split(search).join(replace) to remove all the remaining instances of
          each state. I had to do this as every entry had the State name in it and only one was needed as all the
          entries would be nested under it. I also had to use a .split(search).join(replace) to replace the href tags
          and quotation marks that had been converted to HTML character entities.</p>

        <h2>From Graphic to Code</h2>
        <p>I had made the graphic below in Photoshop and in a moment of curiosity, I wonder if it was possible to
          recreate the text/border portion with HTML/CSS.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid"

        <p class="mt-4">Honestly this is probably how web developers feel when they receive an impractical design to implement, but it was a nice challenge for me. Keep in mind that Internet Explorer had not been killed off yet so it was a NIGHTMARE to design anything remotely creative and still be compatible with it.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">For the top border I created a psuedo border using ::before and ::after</p>

        <p class="mt-5">And then the rest of the box had a regular border"</p>

        <p class="mt-5">Lastly, it had to scale adequately on iPad/smaller laptop screens, so once it reached a certain breaking point, it convert to this design and the background would remain static as the sides closed in:</p>
